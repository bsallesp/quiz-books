You can use scripting languages such as Bash shell scripting (commonly used in Unix and Linux), Microsoft PowerShell (commonly used in Windows), or JavaScript (commonly used in web pages), to name just a few. ### Scripting Fundamentals Scripts can be created using any simple text editor such as _Notepad_ in the Windows environment or _vi_ or _nano_ in Unix and Linux environments. Scripts get interpreted by a _scripting engine_ that is designed to run that specific type of script, so they aren’t compiled code such as an .exe file. This is why scripts can be created in simple text editors and can stay in plaintext format. #### Use Cases for Scripting Here are a few common uses for scripts: Automating repetitive processes, so you don’t have to do so much typing Restarting machines Remapping network drives Installing applications Automating backups Gathering information/data Initiating updates #### Scripting-Related Risks and Hazards When you’re configuring a single PC, it’s important to know what you’re doing, but when you’re using a script to configure dozens or hundreds of PCs at once, that becomes even more important, because a mistake you make in the script that causes a problem on multiple PCs can be disastrous. Here are some especially important risks to watch out for: **Introducing malware** Make very sure that whatever utilities you might be running are from trusted sources and are malware-free. **Bad changes to system settings** Make sure there are no errors or typos in your script that create bad system settings changes, or you’ll be weeks cleaning up the mess. Even if you don’t have any typos, though, you can never be sure that system changes your script makes to multiple PCs will have the same results on each PC. Different hardware, installed apps, and OS versions can all make a difference. **Crashes due to mishandling of resources** Badly scripted changes may create crashes to the OS itself, to browsers, and/or to applications. Registry changes can be especially dangerous to make to multiple machines at a time via scripting. Make sure you understand all these use cases and potential hazards; all these were added as new topics in the latest iteration of the CompTIA A+ exams, so you can assume there will be questions about them. ### Script File Types The type of script you will create depends on factors such as your existing familiarity with a scripting language, existing scripts already in use, the capabilities required in the script to carry out tasks, and the preferred script type used within the organization. For example, JavaScript is used within web pages and is executed by web browsers. Automating administrative tasks in Windows environments is normally done using PowerShell scripts; server-side scripts on web servers might use Python. Some scripting languages are case sensitive, such as JavaScript and Shell scripts. PowerShell scripts are not. [Table 23-1](ch23.xhtml#ch23tab1) lists common script file types. All these scripting file types are listed in CompTIA A+ exam 1102 Objective 4.8. Aside from [Table 23-1](ch23.xhtml#ch23tab1), the rest of this chapter’s information is not on the CompTIA A+ exams, so you do not need to study it for test-taking purposes. You may find it useful on the job, though. TABLE 23-1 Common Scripting File Types ### Scripting Tools You can create a script in any app that creates plaintext files, including Notepad. Fancier scripting programs can be acquired, or in some cases they are built into the operating system, such as the Microsoft PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) seen in [Figure 23-1](ch23.xhtml#ch23fig1). FIGURE 23-1 Microsoft PowerShell IS These tools enhance your script-writing experience by providing Color coding of special keyword types Built-in help system to ease the pain of learning syntax Auto-fill that makes suggestions as you type Ability to run the entire script without leaving the editor Ability to run selected lines in a script to test them ### Data Types The supported data types and related syntax vary between scripting languages, but most scripting languages support common data types such as strings and integers. #### Strings Scripts that deal with user names, filenames, and city names—anything that is a text string—will use some type of string data type. Some scripting language commands work only against certain data types, such as determining the number of characters in a string, as seen in the following JavaScript language where _username_ is the name of a variable and _length_ is a property, or characteristic, of that variable. Notice the dot separating the variable from the property. `username.length` #### Integers Integers are another common data type. An integer is a positive or negative whole number with no decimal places. The specific minimum and maximum values that can be used with integer values depend on your chosen scripting language. JavaScript uses a _number_ data type; there is no specific _integer_ data type. Microsoft PowerShell, on the other hand, does have a specific integer data type with a numeric range of –2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. [Figure 23-2](ch23.xhtml#ch23fig2), using PowerShell, shows the creation of a variable called _age_ being set with a value of _50_. The _.GetType()_ method, or action, is being run against that variable and it returns _Int32,_ which indicates this is an integer variable. PowerShell variables are always preceded with a dollar sign. FIGURE 23-2 Microsoft PowerShell GetType() ### Variables To facilitate working with scripts, script writers often use custom names for values that change throughout their code; these are _variables_. Operating systems also have built-in variables called _environment variables_ that contain values such as the currently logged-on user name, home directory path, version of the operating system, and so on. #### Environment Variables You can use environment variables in your scripts as needed. The syntax to accomplish this varies among scripting languages. [Figure 23-3](ch23.xhtml#ch23fig3) shows how the Linux _env_ command returns environment variables. FIGURE 23-3 Linux environment variables The same type of result is accomplished in a Windows command prompt (also in a batch file) using the _set_ command, as seen in [Figure 23-4](ch23.xhtml#ch23fig4). FIGURE 23-4 Using Windows environment variables through a command prompt We can view environment variables through PowerShell with the _Get-ChildItem env:_ command, as seen in [Figure 23-5](ch23.xhtml#ch23fig5). FIGURE 23-5 Using Windows environment variables through PowerShell #### Script Variables Imagine that you are writing a script that will list the running services on a Windows computer. If you need to use that list of running services over and over again in your code, it’s much more efficient to get the list of services only once, store it in a variable, and then reuse the variable rather than repeatedly getting the list of services each time it’s needed. The following Microsoft PowerShell example stores only running services in a variable named **$running_svcs** ; note that the built-in placeholder variable **$_** is being used to process all returned services—also notice the “equals” operator (**-eq**). `$running_svcs = Get-Service | Where{$_.status –eq \"Running\"}` Whenever you need to list running services in your script, you can simply refer to the **$running_svcs** variable name instead of issuing the original long command again. In PowerShell, you could ask a user to enter a cost center code, which would be stored in a variable: `$cost_center_code = Read-Host(\"Please enter a cost center:\")` In Python, the same thing would look like this: `cost_center_code = raw_input(\"Please enter a cost center:\")` ### Common Scripting Elements Regardless of the scripting language, scripters use certain common elements. Some are related to best practices, such as using comments to document your script. Other items are more functional, such as the conditional execution of commands. #### Comments Comments in scripts make reading the script much easier, even for the script creator after enough time has passed! They explain exactly what the script does and why it does it. Having that information readily available speeds up troubleshooting and script modifications. The way to indicate a comment in a script varies among scripting languages. [Table 23-2](ch23.xhtml#ch23tab2) provides examples of using comments in different scripting languages. TABLE 23-2 Using Comments in Scripts #### Conditional Execution Most languages have a method of running a command only if it meets a specific condition. The general format of an _if_ statement looks like this: The specific syntax varies between languages; if you’re using Python, it would look something like this: In PowerShell, the same example would look like the following sample code. Notice the age variable is being declared as an integer with **[int]** , and also notice the **–lt** operator, which stands for “less than”: #### Looping Loops execute a series of commands zero or more times depending on how they are coded. Sometimes you’ll know how many times you need to run the same code, such as checking ten input fields on a web page; you could run the JavaScript command for testing input validity ten times to ensure that all user input is acceptable. Other times you won’t know how many times you need to run the same code, such as when processing whatever number of files might exist in a subdirectory. Luckily, most scripting languages provide a multitude of looping options. ##### Loop Syntax Most scripting languages support different types of looping constructs. One common loop type is a _while_ loop that tests a condition. While the condition is true, the code within the loop executes. The following Microsoft PowerShell example displays a menu of options to the user until the user presses 3 (“Exit this menu”). In some scripting languages “not equal to” is expressed as `!=` or `<>`, but PowerShell uses **–ne** (not equal). The **switch** statement tests the value of what the user entered (stored in the **$user_entered_choice** variable). ### Active Directory User Logon Scripts Microsoft Active Directory uses a central network database containing user account definitions, groups, and computers, among other items. Commands can be executed via a script when users log on to a machine (also when they log off), whether that script is a batch file, a VB script, or PowerShell. Common uses of logon scripts include the following: Map network drives Set or read environment variables Deploy new software or software updates Run executable programs Any type of script will require the invoker to have permissions to run the script itself. Depending on what the script does, additional permissions might be required. For example, a Linux Shell script requires the invoker to have at least Read (r) and Execute (x) permissions. In [Figure 23-6](ch23.xhtml#ch23fig6), the **ls –l** command lists files with details, the **chmod** command adds the Execute permission for all users, and then the **ls –l** command shows the new permissions. FIGURE 23-6 Viewing and setting Linux Shell script permissions with the ls command Microsoft Group Policy in Active Directory enables the centralized configuration of user and computer settings. A user logon script can be specified in Group Policy, as shown in [Figure 23-7](ch23.xhtml#ch23fig7). The users affected by the group policy object (GPO) will run the logon script. FIGURE 23-7 Specifying a PowerShell logon script in Group Policy The following example shows how a batch file (.bat file) could map a drive for a user upon logon using the _username_ environment variable: `Net Use H: \\\\Server1\\UserHome\\%username%` We could map a drive letter to any shared folder through a PowerShell logon script (.ps1 file) like this: --- ## Appendix ## About the Online Content This book comes complete with: TotalTester Online customizable practice exam software with more than 400 practice exam questions Simulated performance-based questions Video training from the author Bonus glossary Exam Objective Map ### System Requirements The current and previous major versions of the following desktop browsers are recommended and supported: Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Safari.
