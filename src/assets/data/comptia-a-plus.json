When the computer “forgets” the time and date, it is most likely because the motherboard battery, which normally maintains these settings, is getting low on power and you must replace it. **B** is incorrect because it suggests flashing the battery. This procedure (flashing) applies to the upgrade of a firmware chip, not a battery. **C** is incorrect because it suggests recharging the battery with the computer’s AC adapter. Although this procedure will work with a portable system battery, you cannot recharge motherboard batteries with an AC adapter. **D** is incorrect because it suggests selecting a “low-power” option in the firmware settings program. Any low-power setting in the firmware settings refers to the function of the computer itself, not to the battery. You cannot adjust the amount of power the firmware chip draws from its battery."

    "explanation": "A zero-day attack occurs when the hacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability before the software vendor is aware that the vulnerability exists. It gets its name from the fact that the vendor has zero days to patch the vulnerability before the attack. **A** is incorrect because with an on-path attack, the attacking software (or person) secretly inserts itself between two parties in a secure conversation, gathering data from each. **B** is incorrect because some password crackers fall into the _brute-force_ category, which simply means the program tries a huge number of permutations of possible passwords. **D** is incorrect because a _dictionary attack_ is a password-cracking attempt that systematically tries every word in a dictionary as the password."
